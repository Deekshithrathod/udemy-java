functions in Object-Oriented programming are called methods

```java
class Main{
    void functionName(int args){
        // method logic
    }
}
```
objects are passed with reference & primitives are passed with value

return type: void, Objects & primitive

Parameter passing in java
- calling method, called method, actual parameters, formal parameters
- <i>Content of caller method are copied to formal parameters!! </i>
- Objects are passed with reference


Tasks
- Write functions to
  - Find if a number is prime or not
  - Find GCD of two numbers
  - Find the MAX element of an array
---
Method Overloading
- same function name with different parameters or return type

Tasks
- Write functions to
    - Overload Areas i.e. area of square, area of circle etc.
    - Overload to reverse a number or array
    - Overload method to validate name and age
      - validation of age & name should happen with same function signature

Varargs
- takes in multiple args of a data type or new array;

Tasks to use varargs
- Maximum of the given numbers
- Calc sum of All elements
- Calc discount value of the cart ( use a const discount percentage)

Command line arguments
- javac ClassName.java
- java ClassName (.class file is executed here)

Tasks
- Add Numbers sent from the command line
  - Use regex to see if a string is double or not

Recursion
- A function calling itself
